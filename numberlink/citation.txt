Again, everything in the numberlink folder is from the source link above 
(except the file gen_json.py which was written by Thuy)
We refer to this code for generating a random board (called in generate.ml) and 
this is the only code in our project that is from an outside source. 
It is in Python and does not count towards our lines of code. We do not 
claim this code to be ours in any way and only use it to enhance the 
enjoyment of our game.

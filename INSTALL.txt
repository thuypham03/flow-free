## Install Directions

Our program requires the installation of OCaml Graphics and some Python libraries:

1. To install OCaml Graphics:
open a new terminal and run
    [opam install graphics]

2. Running and playing Flow
Once you have this installed, it's time to run our game!

  a. Download the submitted source code zip file from CMS.
  b. Make a new folder in VS Code to run our program in a directory of your choice (perhaps your 3110 directory) by running:
    [mkdir FlowMS3]
    [cd FlowMS3]
  c. Open VS Code in FlowMS3 by running 
    [code .]
  d. Drag and drop the downloaded submission zip file into folder FlowMS3 by the means specific to your computer.
  e. Open the zip file in the folder FlowMS3 by running 
    [unzip ms3_code.zip]

  This will extract our submission code into a folder directory named FlowMS3.

  f. You are now in the FlowMS3 directory. From here you will be able to run the "make" commands.

  g. Run
  [make build]

3. To install Python libraries, use your pip installer to install the required libraries (they should be marked in yellow in VS Code if you do not have them)
Example: 
  [pip3 install matplotlib]

4. Playing the game:
Now that you have all of the modules installed, it is time to play the game!

  a. Run
  [make build]
  [make play]

  b. A welcome screen will pop up and a Directions panel tells the user the game rules. 
  
  There are 3 difficulties: 
  EASY: random boards 5x5 - 8x8 
  MEDIUM: random boards 9x9 - 12x12 
  HARD: random boards 13x13 - 15x15 

  Click a box to get started! To play again, close the graphics window and repeat steps a-b.
